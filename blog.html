            <h3>Detailed Review of Poco X3 Pro – Should you buy it
               in 2022?

               You might be purchasing the poco x3 pro as your primary smartphone. That is why, you are here and
               looking for an honest review of poco x3 pro.
               First, let’s talk about the phone manufacturing company itself. POCO is the sub-brand of xiaomi
               (popularly known as “MI”). Poco have been rolling out the phones that have highest specification in
               terms of performance. First, poco phone that changed the market was POCO F1, which was powered with
               “Snapdragon 845”, which was the best processor out there in the market at that time. Many of us have
               heard that the Poco X3 Pro is the successor of Poco F1 because poco f1 killed the market in every aspect
               at the time when it was launched. In the same way, Poco X3 pro came with the market with very impressive
               specifications.

                  <p>
                     There will be no debate on the point that the poco x3 pro is the performance champ at its price
                     range. None of the smartphones in the market is providing you this level of performance and the
                     chip used in the phone. The storage type of this phone is UFS 3.1, which you will find only in
                     the high end flagship smartphones. Installing the applications is too much fast in the phone.
                     Every kind of application takes much as 10 second to install in this device.

                     <li>
                        It gives the Snapdragon 865. In this price segment , none of the phone have gave this much
                        powerful processor.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        It has UFS 3.1 storage, which you will only find in premium flagship phones.

                     <li>
                        It has very aggressive price to its competitors.
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                     Conclusion:<br>z
                     To conclude being honest, if you’re considering purchasing the Poco X3 Pro, it’s most likely
                     because of its performance. The Snapdragon 860, which uses a 7nm technology, is nearly identical
                     to the Snapdragon 855+ from 2019, but at around 350 dollars, it’s a great offer that should keep
                     the competition on their toes for a long time.

            <h3> How to host free static website on GitHub?</h3>

               Web hosting is the process of renting or buying space on the World Wide Web to place a website. In order
               for a website to be visible on the internet, the HTML, CSS, and images that make up the site must be
               stored on a server. Hosting a website involves a few prerequisites, especially when it comes to hosting
               free static websites. One popular option for hosting free static websites is using GitHub. This guide
               breaks down the steps into several parts: creating a GitHub account, building a new project, uploading
               files to the repository folder, and publishing the website.
               Firstly, let's explore what GitHub is and why it has gained immense popularity. GitHub is often referred
               to as a social network for developers, allowing them to share and publish their code. While that is
               true, it doesn't fully capture the uniqueness of GitHub. However, we won't <span class="read-more"
                  id="read-more-2">Read more..</span>
               <span class="more-content-2 hidden">
                  delve into extensive details
                  about GitHub's functionalities and workings as it is assumed that you already have a basic
                  understanding. If you are interested, you can set up your own website using GitHub by following the
                  steps outlined in this guide.
                  <ul>
                     <li>
                        A. Creating a GitHub Account: The first step is to create a GitHub account with a unique
                        username.
                        GitHub provides not only free hosting but also allows you to connect with other developers
                        and
                        contribute to open-source projects. To create an account, you can visit the GitHub homepage
                        and
                        follow
                        the instructions. After creating your account, you'll need to verify your email address.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        B. Building a New Project: Once your GitHub account is set up, it's time to create a new
                        project
                        where
                        you'll upload all the assets of your website. On the left side of the GitHub homepage, click
                        the
                        "Create
                        Repository" button. Provide a name and details for your project. It's important to make the
                        repository
                        public and check the option to initialize it with a README file. This will create your
                        project
                        repository.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        C. Uploading the Files to the Repository Folder: With the repository created, you can now
                        upload
                        the
                        files that make up your website. It's crucial to name the opening page of your site as
                        index.html
                        since
                        GitHub and other hosting services typically look for this file. You can either drag and drop
                        your
                        files
                        or use the "Choose your files" option to upload them from your computer. After uploading,
                        commit
                        the
                        changes by clicking the "Commit changes" button.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        D. Publishing the Website: After successfully uploading your files to the repository, the
                        next
                        step
                        is
                        to publish your website to host it as a free static website on GitHub. This is a critical
                        section,
                        so
                        ensure that you follow the steps correctly. Go to the repository's settings and look for the
                        "Pages"
                        section. Set the "Source" to the "master" or "main" branch and save the settings. Once
                        saved,
                        the
                        page
                        will reload, and you will receive a message stating that your site is ready to be published
                        at a
                        specific URL. Click the URL to view your website.

                     In conclusion, this article provides a comprehensive guide on hosting a free static website on
                     GitHub.
                     By following the steps outlined above, you can create a GitHub account, build a new project,
